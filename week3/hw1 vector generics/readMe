1. Brief Class Description
===============================================
Product -
Overrides hashcode, toString, and equals.
Product in an inventory, stores product Id, name, category, price, quantity in stock, supplier.

Product Inventory -
Represents a collection of product objects via vector.
Has adding, removing, search by ID, filter, low stock, inventory value, and vector capacity methods.

OrderItem -
Just shows a item within an order.
Takes in product Id, name, quantity, etc kinda like Product class except it shows subtotal instead of supplier.

Order -
Store Customer's order, the total OrderItem objects, order Id, customer name, date, status of the order
Has methods like adding and removing, total cost, status update on order, and printing order details.

Order Manager -
Manager of orders placed or created. Has adding orders, canceling order, finding orders, getPending order,
filtering by status or customer to get order details, total revenue, total order count, and print every order in the system.

Vector Utils -
Has generic methods utilized to swap elements, find max element, filter products,
return sum of numbers, returns average of numbers all via generics.

Generic Container -
Vector backed class. Has add, remove, remove, size, getAll, clear, contains, and addAll methods.

InventorySystemMain -
The most tedious of all is the main class. Shows the workings of the code, shows off system features like
inventory managment, order processing, comprehrensive test to make sure everything works and prints along side a very
interactive menu.

2. Comiple and Run
===============================================
Just compile files and run Main.java or InventorySystemMain.java
-InventorySystemMain.java test everything and prints before the interactive menu comes up

3. Challenges
===============================================
- Finding the right syntax and code for memory portion was hard
- Making sure edge cases are handled EVERY TIME
- Trying to understand the Vector capacity part
- Some parts were vague and hard to understand so I tried my best

4. What I Learned about Vectors and Generics
===============================================
- Difference between Vectors and ArrayList
- How to utilize edge cases
- Understand how capacity and affect performance, memory usage and speed
- How to design different modular systems

5. Vector Comparison Summary(Task 3.3)
===============================================
-Performance Observed-
ArrayList is faster in time to add 11.54ms versus Vector's 26.94ms

-Choose Vector-
When dealing with legacy code and need thread safety

-Choose ArrayList-
For more modern and higher performance based. Faster than Vector in absences of syncs which
allows for operations like add(), remove().
